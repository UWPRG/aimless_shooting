Python code for Aimless Shooting adapted from "Obtaining reaction coordinates by likelihood maximization" from Peters and Trout doi: [10.1063/1.2234477](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2234477). This package is developed and maintained by Sarah Alamdari and Luke Gibson, members of the Pfaendtner Research Group.
